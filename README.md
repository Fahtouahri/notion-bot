# üìã Notion Bot Overview

**Notion Bot** is a set of Python scripts designed to automate reminders and notifications for tasks in Notion. These reminders are based on data retrieved from a Snowflake database and are sent via Slack using the Slack API. The bot helps ensure that deadlines are met and that tasks are kept up to date by sending reminders to task creators and reviewers as needed.

## ‚≠ê Features
- **Automated notifications** for task owners and reviewers on Slack.
- **Reminders based on task deadlines** (lead times), using different conditions such as "On Hold" or "Pending more information."
- **Flexible configuration** using environment variables (e.g., for test mode, Slack tokens, etc.).
- **Automatic handling of overdue tasks**, sending regular reminders until the task is updated.

## üìö Libraries and Dependencies
The following libraries are used in this project:

- `slack_sdk`: Slack API client used to send messages and reminders to users on Slack.
- `snowflake.connector`: Used to connect to the Snowflake database to retrieve task and recommendation data.
- `os`: For managing environment variables and other system-related tasks.
- `logging`: Used for logging actions, errors, and messages to help monitor the scripts' execution.
- `datetime`: Handles date and time operations for calculating deadlines, overdue tasks, etc.
- `sys`: For system-related functions, like exiting the program in case of errors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
Before running the scripts, make sure the following are in place:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
- A **Snowflake account** with the necessary permissions to query the relevant tables.
- A **Slack workspace** with a bot token. You must create a Slack app and enable permissions to send messages (`chat:write`) and retrieve user information (`users:read`).
- **Environment variables** to store sensitive information like Slack tokens and Snowflake credentials.

### Required Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables:

```bash
export SLACK_API_TOKEN=your-slack-api-token
export SNOWFLAKE_USER=your-snowflake-username
export SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your-snowflake-password
export SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=your-snowflake-warehouse
export SNOWFLAKE_ROLE=your-snowflake-role
export SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=your-snowflake-schema
